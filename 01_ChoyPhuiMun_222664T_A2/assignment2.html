            <p>Before we dive into the world of Tectonic Plates, we first need to know what makes up the Earth.</p>
            <p>
                The Earth is made out of <strong>four</strong> major layers. staring from the topmost layer:
                the <strong>Crust</strong>, <strong>Mantle</strong>,
                <strong> Outer Core</strong> and the <strong> Inner Core </strong> being the deepest layer.

            <p>Tectonic Plates consist of the Earth's outermost layer, or called <strong>lithosphere</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Lithosphere</strong> is made up of the <strong>crust</strong> and the <strong>upper mantle</strong> - which is broken up into large plates called 
            <strong> tectonic plates</strong>.</p>
            <p> Due to the plates lying on the <strong>Asthenosphere</strong> (partially molten layer of rock),
                convection between these planes would cause the tectonic plates to move about 2 to 15 centimeters
                relative to each other per year.

                Plate Boundaries are zones that where an lithospheric plate meent another lithospheric plate and they are borders of plates.
                At these plate Boundaries, plates would interact with each other due to stress accumulated and released at these zones, which causes them to move
            </p>
            <p>
                The movement in these plate boundaries can be categorised to three types of Plate Boundaries: <strong>Convergent</strong>, 
                <strong>Divergent</strong> and <strong>Transform</strong> boudaries.

                Earthquakes is the shaking of the surface which is caused by a sudden release of stored energy in rocks found along fault line (transform plate boundaries).
            </p>
            <p>
                This sudden movement of the ground could lead to destruction that can impact us human.
                These are the negative effects of earthquakes to humans.

            <p>
                As it is an unexpected event, peopel would not be prepared or have enought time to evacuate safely.
                Thus, many people would lose thier lives due the earthquakes.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to prevent from losing lives, places which are more prove to earthquakes should have their Government or Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) to implement evacuation drills to train their residents
                what should they do when an earthquake starts. This would increase the level of prepareness of those affected.

            <p>
                Some building are not earthquake-proof due to it being old or not have stable fondation.
                These builings are dangerous during the earthquake as it not strong enough to withstand the shaking of the ground and can be easily destroyed.
                It is alo dangerous for residents to be near to these kinds of building as it might injure or kill people near it once it get destroyed and crumbled.
            </p>

            <p>
                The government of these places that are prone of earthquakes could implement regular checks on buildinga to make sure that in th case of emergency,the buildig is stable and safe enough for residents to take shelter.
